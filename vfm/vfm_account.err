Can't call method "selectall_arrayref" on an undefined value at
	/mico/vfm/vfm_get_account.pl line 30 (#1)
    (F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
    object reference or package name contains an undefined value.  Something
    like this will reproduce the error:
    
        $BADREF = undef;
        process $BADREF 1,2,3;
        $BADREF->process(1,2,3);
